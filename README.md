# Live Reconstruction of Wigner Distribution Deconvolution
This repository is the reimplementation of Wigner Distribution Deconvolution (WDD) for live reconstruction and
to reproduce the results in the paper

To benchmark with existing implementation of WDD we refer to pyPtychoSTEM implementation can be acessed in the following link: https://gitlab.com/pyptychostem/pyptychostem

The datasets for graphene and WSe2 can be downloaded in the following:
1. Graphene: https://zenodo.org/record/4476506#.YxioTdVBxH5
2. WSe2: https://zenodo.org/record/6477629#.YxioMdVBxH5
3. Experimental SrTiO3: https://zenodo.org/record/5113449#.Yxnh7dVBxH4

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the code in this repository:

```
numpy
scipy
LiberTEM
```
and can be installed with ```pip install -e```

This repository is presented to reproduce the result and act as supplementary material in the paper below. For continues development please refer the Ptychography 4.0 repository: ```Here provide link```
